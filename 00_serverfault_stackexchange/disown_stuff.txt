Allow sub-processes to live beyond the shell that they are attached to.

Keep job (do not disown it), but mark it so that no future SIGHUP is received on shell exit:
disown -h %job_number
Remember, that even if you type yourExecutable & and the outputs keep coming on the screen and Ctrl+C does not seem to stop anything, just blindly type disown; and press Enter even if the screen is scrolling with outputs and you can't see what you're typing. The process will get disowned and you'll be able to close the terminal without the process dying

ctrl-z
bg
disown -h %job_number

You can't disown a pid or process, you disown a job!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allows for a process to live when the terminal gets killed.
Run process that can live beyond the terminal:
nohup command options

or nohup -p pid if the process is already started (only AIX & solaris)

reptyr
grab.c
cryopid

neercs is another option
