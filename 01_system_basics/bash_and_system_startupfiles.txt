                    Login                                   Non-Login
Interactive         Initial shell (console/ssh login)       any subsequent shell (eg opening a terminal window)
Non-interactive     rarely used                             temporary life eg when running a bash script



Login Shell
-----------

1) Reads /etc/profile (sources /etc/bash.bashrc in an ubuntu system, and /etc/bashrc on macOS to set system-level paths and environmental variables on users shells.). Then the bash shell looks for one of the following three
    ~/.bash_profile (best practice to call ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc if using bash as the main shell)
    ~/.bash_login
    ~/.profile (sources ~/.bashrc in an Ubuntu system). This is for keeping environment settings not-specific to any particular shell eg $PATH

Non-Login Shell
-----------
1) Reads /etc/bash.bashrc, and then looks for:
    ~/.bashrc  (bash-specific settings only, PS1, PS2, aliases and functions etc). This file is read by sub-shells etc.
will inherit settings from its parent shell


In addition to setting the environmental items the /etc/profile will execute the scripts within /etc/profile.d/*.sh.
