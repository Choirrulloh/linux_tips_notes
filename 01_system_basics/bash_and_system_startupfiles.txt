Login Shell
-----------

/etc/profile (calls /etc/bash.bashrc in an ubuntu system which is somewhat not correct)
~/.bash_profile (best practice to call ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc if using bash as the main shell)
~/.bash_login
~/.profile (calls ~/bashrc in an ubuntu system, which isn't really the best practice). keep settings not-specific to bash here eg $PATH

Non-Login Shell
-----------
/etc/bash.bashrc
~/.bashrc  (bash-specific settings only, PS1, PS2, aliases and functions etc). This file is read by sub-shells etc.
will inherit settings from its parent shell
