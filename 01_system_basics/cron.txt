read crontabs every minute

on both redhat and debian
/var/spool/cron/ contains crontabs
/etc/cron.d/ contains individual crontabs for software or other purposes with custom schedules (typically redhat)
/etc/crontab specifies where to look for daily weekly and monthly tasks on Debian systems
    references cron.hourly, cron.daily, cron.weekly and cron.monthly
    is populated on Debian-based systems, but empty on redhat systems though

redhat uses /etc/anacrontab instead for these intervals

on the user crontabs, the user field will be blank

can put scripts in cron.hourly, daily, weekly & monthly directories if we want

more control of time when to run: /etc/cron.d directory instead

user cronjobs in cron -e command

eg
52 * * * *  logger "Hello from user crontab entry"


cron = every minute (high frequency)
anacron = daily (high reliability)
/etc/anacrontab
period in days where something needs to be done
also have a delay that can be set to avoid clashes
anacron is called by cron periodically; redhat systems in a script called 0anacron in /etc/cron.daily/
