/etc/grub.d
are grub scripts

config file is in /etc/default/grub
after changes, run grub2-mkconfig
generates new configs for /boot/grub2


init
----
init runs as pid 1
runlevels and their numbering
runlevel command
shows previous and current runlevels
(N = no runlevel previously)
run levels are set with the init command commonly done using init scripts located in /etc/init.d (and run when the runlevel changes)
eg /etc/init.d/ssh

ls -ld /etc/rc*
for each runlevel the scripts in /etc/init.d are symlinked into the directories that share the specific runlevels
ls -l /etc/rc2.d/ for example
A link file starting with 'S' indicates to use the start section of the linked script and a name starting with 'K' means to kill or stop the script
The number following S/K indicates the order in which to run the script.
name following that reflects the name of the script being linked to


Own scripts
----------
/etc/rc.local
is run at runlevel transitions

All scripts can also be run manually using the service command followed by script name and an action argument
eg. sudo service networking restart
then name of the service is in /etc/init.d/. The argument is defined in that script in a switch/case statement
Different distros treat runlevels differently and they offer different tools to work with the scripts & runlevel assignments

systemd
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manages background services after the system has started
logger, openssh, webserver, file server
is pid 1
running kernel -> usable userspace
instead of runlevels, uses targets (composed of units/unit-files, which can start/run in parallel)
"graphical" is the usual target of most systems
Other targets (emergency, rescue)
systemctl command
systemctl status rsyslog.service 
also shows how many processes it is currently supervising

less /lib/systemd/system/rsyslog.service
