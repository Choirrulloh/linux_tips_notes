(Not on macOS) /etc/passwd  (user accounts on the system). lots of service accounts + maybe a couple of user accounts

uname:x:uid:gid:gecos:location of home folder & working directory upon logging in: default shell

x: encrypted passwd in /etc/shadow file

uid: with 1000 or above are human users (or regular users) below 1000 are system accounts
gid: numeric value for users primary group. Again the 1000 rule as above for regular/system groups
uid & gid are actually used to resolve the names & groups 

gecos: descriptive field name,location & phone information. Human-friendly name for the user, and some commas for the empty information

default shell: set to false for system accounts


/etc/shadow
-----------

1 username:
2 * or ! or a string representing the encrypted passwd: * invalid hash. account has been disabled, ! : account has been locked
3 days since epoch since passwd change:
4 how long to wait to change their passwd  number of days until passwd expires:
5 days before which to warn user of passwd expiry :
6 how many days must pass before an account with an expired passwd will be disabled:
7 how many days an account has been disabled
8 reserved for future use

/etc/group
----------
gname
passwd (x implies no group passwd set)
gid
csv list of users in the group


for particular user and group info, use the id or groups commands

from the otherside use the getent command to see who is in a group
getent group groupname

adduser is a friendlier frontend for useradd

/etc/skel is the skeleton home directory used as template for new users

sudo addgroup newgroupname

modify  group memberships (add/delete users)
usermod
sudo usermod -aG groupname uname
-a (append information)
-G (add a supplementary group), don't replace the user's primary group

usermod (lock & unlock accounts)

sudo usermod -L uname (lock account)
sudo usermod -U uname (unlock account)

sudo passwd 
change current user's passwd
sudo passwd uname
change uname's passwd

sudo delgroup groupname
sudo deluser username (but uid and home dir will still exist). If a new person created an account with the same uid, they would have access to everything the old user created
sudo deluser --remove-home username
