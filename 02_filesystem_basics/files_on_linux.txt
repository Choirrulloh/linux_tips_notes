location of blocks are stored in inodes
inodes are kept in an inode table


what we see as files in an 'ls' hierarchy are hardlinks to each file's inode
When u access it, system looks up all the blocks that represents pieces of the file and return the data from them

magic number to recognise file formats since extensions are not reliable
a particula value at the beginning of a file

use the 'file' command to get this info
the 'stat' command is helpful too (to show more inode info,size etc)
