a file that contains a filesystem
file can be moved to other systems to take the filesystem along with it
iso images like linux installers are loop devices
snaps use loop devices for their permanent filesystem
macos calls them "disk images"


can create them using dd or fallocate command (fast). Can write zeros to a file
fallocate -l 1G myimage
sudo mkfs.ext4 myimage
use fallocate again to make this image sparse (so that it doesn't actually take up space on the disk)
fallocate -d myimage
can shrink and grow as data is added to it

create a place to mount it and mount
mkdir /mnt/myfiles
sudo mount myimage /mnt/myfiles

ll /dev/loop*
losetup to explore loop devices

move out of the mount folder and umount it
umount /mnt/myfiles

set gid bit
sudo chmod 2775 /shared_folder
after adding new users to this group need to log out & back in for changes to take effect
sudo chgrp shared_group_name /shared_folder

debian umask is 022 which means files created by user will be 644 (group will have only read access)
other distros have umask 0022, meaning 664 giving users in the group write access 
can set the umask in each user's .bashrc file
