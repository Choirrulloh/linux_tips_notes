allow us to lay one set of files on top of another creating what looks like a single set of files 

eg. user-modifiable layer on top of a root fs
lower fs (often a read-only fs, possible to do more than 1 lower fs) + upper fs (usually writable fs)

write : to upper fs
edit a file in lower fs: system will copy the changes to upper fs

eg
md fs_a fs_b
touch fs_a/a_file_{0..5}
touch fs_b/b_file_{0..5}
echo "This is on filesystem A!" > fs_a/myfile
echo "This is on filesystem B!" > fs_b/myfile
md working
md myoverlay

sudo mount -t overlay overlay -o lowerdir=fs_a,upperdir=fs_b,workdir=working myoverlay
mntpoint is myoverlay

cd myoverlay

ls -l

cat myfile will show the echo to B fs

editing a file from the lowerfs will simply copy it to the upper fs
eg vim a_file_0
will copy it to the upper fs

Used very widely in embedded systems (no power guarantees), so keeping health of a fs can be tricky. Boot from RO fs, and then layer on top of that. If a write operation is happening and the system loses power, the lower FS is protected from bad writes. data may be lost, but systems integrity is protected


Also used in live-boot linux disks

sudo umount myoverlay after being done with it
