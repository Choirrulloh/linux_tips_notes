allow us to lay one set of files on top of another creating what looks like a single set of files

eg. user-modifiable layer on top of a root fs
lower fs (often a read-only fs, possible to do more than 1 lower fs) + upper fs (usually writable fs)

write : to upper fs
edit a file in lower fs: system will copy the changes to upper fs

eg
md fs_a fs_b
touch fs_a/a_file_{0..5}
touch fs_b/b_file_{0..5}
echo "This is on filesystem A!" > fs_a/myfile
echo "This is on filesystem B!" > fs_b/myfile
md working
md myoverlay (to serve as mountpoint)

Creating an overlay mount
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo mount -t overlay overlay -o lowerdir=fs_a,upperdir=fs_b,workdir=working myoverlay
mntpoint is myoverlay

cd myoverlay

ls -l

cat myfile will show the echo to B fs

editing a file from the lowerfs will simply copy it to the upper fs
eg vim a_file_0
will copy the file to the upper fs


can be used to merge volumes together into one filesystem

Used very widely in embedded systems (no power guarantees), so keeping health of a fs can be tricky. Boot from RO fs, and then layer more filesystems on top of that. If a write operation is happening and the system loses power, the lower FS is protected from bad writes. data may be lost, but the system's integrity is protected


Also used in live-boot linux disks

sudo umount myoverlay after being done with it
