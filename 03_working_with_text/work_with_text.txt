grep -a 

treat binary files as text (but can get garbage on screen)

better to pass it through the strings command


sed

append use the 'a' command

eg sed "a newtext" file.txt will append 'newtext' to a new line

insert before the last line, use the 'i' command
insert before the 3rd line, sed "3i newtext" file.txt
append after the 3rd line, sed "3a newtext" file.txt

delete all lines, sed "d" file.txt
delete 1st line, sed "1d" file.txt

sed "/regex/d" file.txt
sed "/regex/a appended_text" file.txt to append a line starting with "appended_text" to the line containing the regex
