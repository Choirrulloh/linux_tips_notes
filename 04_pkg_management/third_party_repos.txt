Third party repositories

apt repositories are listed at /etc/apt/sources.list and individual files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory
nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plex.list 

deb
or deb-src

deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main

'public' - distribution
sometimes 'testing'
'main' branch
curl https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | sudo apt-key add -

grep in /var/lib/apt/lists/  to know the actual name of the package

apt cache show "plex*"
apt install plexmediaserver
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plex.list
sudo apt-key list
find the signature for  the key, copy the long hex string
sudo apt-key del 'paste the long key here'


for scripting, there is an easier way by using add-apt-repository. Same as above for getting the key

sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main"


For yum
------
/etc/yum.conf
/etc/yum.repos.d/

baseurl=https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/rpm/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key
gpgcheck=1

yum list plexmediaserver
can host it somewhere and iinstall it using a cli tool called yum config manager
