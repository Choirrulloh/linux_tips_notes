Third party repositories

apt repositories are listed at /etc/apt/sources.list file and other individual files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory
nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plex.list

deb
or deb-src for binary or source-based packages

deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main

'public' - distribution
sometimes 'testing'
'main' branch
curl https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | sudo apt-key add -

grep in /var/lib/apt/lists/  to know the actual name of the package or easier to just use apt-cache like below:
apt cache show "plex*"

apt install plexmediaserver
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plex.list
sudo apt-key list
find the signature for  the key, copy the long hex string
sudo apt-key del 'paste the long key here'


for scripting, there is an easier way by using add-apt-repository. Same as above for getting the key

sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main" which will automatically run apt update first

The string in quotes above is the same as manually editing the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory

man sources.list for more information about this file


For yum
------
/etc/yum.conf  which is equivalent to /etc/apt/sources.list
/etc/yum.repos.d/ which is equivalent to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory

[PlexRepo]
name=PlexRepo
baseurl=https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/rpm/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key
gpgcheck=1

yum list plexmediaserver
can host it on a sever somewhere and install it using a cli tool called yum config manager. Take a look at its manpage
