wayland doesn't provide remote desktop

startx
VNC will share the entire desktop of the remote machine

ssh -Y (enables trusted forwarding)
X11 forwarding has its share of security vulnerabilities and speed problems
Old approach designed for local networks
Are sandboxed. Can't drag & drop a file from a remote system to a local system using the GUI file manager
startxfce4


To connect to a remote desktop
------------------------------

For server
------------------------------
Use VNC
Uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol to send the contents of the graphical display to a remote client
TightVNC server
apt install tightvncserver
Install a desktop environment of choice
Then run the vncserver command, which will set up a virtual display
There are no users in the VNC authentication scheme (just passwords)
VNC server starts display 1 onwards from port 5901 onwards
Virtual display 2: port 5902
Virtual display 3: port 5903
etc.
Open up firewall on these ports 5901 etc
sudo ufw allow from 10.0.2.0/24 to any port 5901
Not a good idea to expose a VNc server to the internet (due to that short 8 character password). This is not secure unlike SSH secured with a key
vim ~/.vnc/xstartup
comment out export XKL_XMODMAP_DISABLE=1 (if not using the Gnome desktop). Commenting out will help the xfce session we are using to get the right icons and an overall better experience
/etc/X11/Xsession will call the default desktop environment (if u have more than one desktop environment, then needs different configuration)
vncserver -kill :1
start a new one with vncserver

For client
------------------------------
vinagre is an option
VNC viewer for chrome is an option too
needs address and port information

For better experience, set desktop background to a solid colour (instead of detailed photo or design)
Turn off  screensaver

NEVER ENABLE DESKTOP POWER SAVINGS to make sure that the remote server does not sleep. You cannot wake it up over vnc!!!


Other remote access options
--------------------------

3rd party service to broker the connection between the server and the client
Use outbound connections from both server and client to the 3rd party hub software
eg. Bomgar, TeamViewer
works with dynamic IP addresses
Best for scale out, avoid individual configuration & provide roaming access
