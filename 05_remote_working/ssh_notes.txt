On Server
---------
systemctl status sshd
ufw allow 22/tcp
ufw enable
/etc/ssh/sshd_config (server config)
/etc/ssh/ssh_config (client config)
AddressFamily  (if necessary, restrict to listen on a specific local interface, or internal dmz)
HostKey (the key information that the server will send back to the client)
SysLogFacility AUTH (can set the level of detail of logging)
LoginGraceTime 2m (how long do we have to enter our credentials)
can set up Kerberos for organizational directory-based login
PrintMotd yes
PrintLastLog yes
UsePAM yes (yes pluggable authentication modules. Allows local login or other kinds of authentication)
PermitRootLogin no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
systemctl restart sshd
on a cloud VM, you typically get an internal IP address


Other directives not in the sshd server config file
AllowUsers, AllowGroups
DenyUsers, DenyGroups
Or also ranges of network addresses or hostnames

On Client
---------
apt install openssh-client

who command should show the users logged in

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
scp/sftp


ssh-keygen
permissions of the private key are pretty restrictive. Only the user has rw permissions

public-key, starts with ssh-rsa CAPS_PUBLIC_KEY comments
ssh-add to store the key on the keyring

tail -f /var/log/auth.log

To find the fingerprint of the key, we use
ssh-keygen -lf <path_to_private_key>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ssh tunnels
-----------

Forward traffic from a port on a local machine to a port on a remote machine
Very common to use with database servers or development web servers where the service is not exposed to the internet wherein we cannot connect to it directly.

Stop-over on an ssh-server
Useful in securing servers. Reduce outside exposure to just one ssh server

ssh -L local_client_machine>1024:remotehost:port_on_remote_machine user@remotehost
ssh -L local_client_machine>1024:otherremotehost:port_on_remote_machine user@remotehost

example: a website on port 80 running on remotehost, tunnelled to local port 1234


After connecting, all we need to do is visit a web browser and type in address bar, localhost:1234


ssh -L local_client_machine>1024:otherremotehost:port_on_remote_machine user@remotehost -N  (no shell)


Browsing the web through a proxy
---------------------------------
SOCK proxy (socket secure). VPN for web traffic (rather than all traffic)
forward traffic from client through proxy server as though its coming from the ssh server itself
    can be used to control web traffic/web access
    can allow web access from restrictive networks (quick and easy vpn, in coffee shop or airport wifi)

ssh -D localport user@remotehost -Nqf
-D (dynamic port forwarding)
-N (no shell)
-q (quiet)
-f (fork the process into the background, requires killing with pid)
-C (compress)

check ip
then configure browser
check ip again
SOCKS5 proxy manual configuration. localhost, port 4321
send DNS queries also to the proxy server
Doesn't affect cookies, cache etc. It is just one kind of protection. Does not avoid tracking etc.
Introduce a little bit of slowdown
