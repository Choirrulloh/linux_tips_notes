pid can be released after a process terminates
Only in linux, ps -C commandname
show the process with that command name
ps -fC commandname
-f full-listing

instead of -f,  -jH for tree-format (helpful for human eyes)
H = hierarchical
j = jobs-format wherein we get process group id and session id as well

SID is the process id of the session leader

-u effective user
-U real-user (seems to be preferred in Scott's video?)

ps -u krishna shows a lot of options

better managed with ps -fHU krishna

-e for everything
might be useful with hierarchical view

default kill signal is called SIGTERM (-15)
more forceful signal is SIGKILL (-9)

kill -l to get a list of all available values
