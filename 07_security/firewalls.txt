because of the existence of netfilter (networking guts of the linux kernel)
but can't directly configure netfilter. Hence, we need some tools

Two conflicting daemons that both can be used to make netfilter do its thing
1. iptables (older, might be deprecated in the future)
2. firewalld (newer, but different security metapho, easier to configure)

cannot run both at the same time on the same system
require some mutual exclusion rules before we can get started

systemctl status iptables
iptables is located under /sbin/  (symlinked to xtables-multi)

to prevent it from running in the future, do systemctl mask iptables will symlink to /dev/null. need to stop the daemon before masking

Other rule-based firewalls
--------------------------
iptables
ip6tables
arptables
ebtables
sudo iptables -L -n -v  (to list the current rules in numeric format verbosely)

nc destination_ip port_no
some text to send

nc -lp  4545   (listen on port 4545)

will appear on the above netcat session

iptables rules are organized in chains. If not matching, the default action of the chain is taken. Chains can refer to other chains, which makes it possible to build fairly complex rules

Need to export the entire set of information, and import it back again

sudo iptables-save > myfirewallrules.txt

vim myfirewallrules.txt
top of file contains list of chains

Then later on, we append rules to the chains using the -A command

sudo iptables-restore myfirewallrules.txt

sudo iptables -A INPUT -s source_ip -j DROP
-A (append to current set of rules to the specified chain)
-s source address
-j specifies the action to take

sudo iptables -R INPUT 1 -s source_ip -p tcp --dport 4545 -j DROP (or jump to another chain)
-R Replaces the above rule with a new rule to drop any tcp packets packets onto 4545 from the source ip


sudo iptables -D INPUT 1  (delete the rule above)

can also do source_ip/26 for example

-m connlimit --connlimit-above 2  (max 2 concurrent connections)

Ordering matters
----------------
REJECT rule  (eg. the above concurrent rule)
then ACCEPT rule

sudo iptables -R INPUT 1 -s source_ip -p tcp --dport 4545 -j DROP

Rate-limiting traffic (directed to ports 80 & 443) from anywhere
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dports 80,443 -m limit --limit 120/minute --limit-burst 250 -j ACCEPT


Diver telnet traffic  to a honeypot
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 23 -j DNAT --to 10.0.2.199

Log dropped packets
sudo iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "ipt-block:"

Block any other input
sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP

Check the NAT table
-------------------
sudo iptables -t nat -L -n


ufw allow|deny port/protocol (default behavior of ufw is to deny access to anything not explicitly allowed)

can also fine-tune a rule to allow/deny connections to a specific address or range of addresses, or on specific interfaces
sudo ufw allow from 10.0.2.0/24 to any port 22
sudo ufw status
Rules are evaluated in the order in which they appear (permissive rule followed by restrictive rule, implies that the earlier rule will apply)
sudo ufw delete (rule number or allow 22/tcp)
For more complex rules, need iptables
