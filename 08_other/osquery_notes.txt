Set of tools that lets u gather system_info in a way that can be queried like a relational database
construct periodic reports to show info like processes, launch items, open ports
osqueryi (interactive shell to explore)
osqueryd (daemon to run on systems where we want to collect information)
osqueryctl (service control program to manage the daemon)
information is presented as a series of tables
to find those tables, type .tables

To read information from these tables, use straight forward SQL
select * from system_info;

for a little bit more readable output
.mode line

select * from python_packages
To narrow this down a bit, .scheme command for the create statement for the table
.scheme python_packages

select version from python_packages where name="parallax";

To record information on an ongoing basis, need to run osqueryd

Need a config file to tell it how to operate
sudo nano /etc/osquery/osquery.conf
Looks like a json format

then sudo osqueryctl start
Information will be logged into the local database. WIll have some log files about the status and results of the logging operations
cd /var/log/osquery
To log centrally, use a combo of rsyslog, splunk, logstash and more (see the osquery doc)
