SMB or CIFS protocols are quite popular

The name CIFS referred to an older version of the SMB protocol

In modern times, the terms pretty much mean the same thing
Strictly speaking they are a little bit different

SMB (originally at IBM), mod by Microsoft. Foundation for Microsoft Windows Networking
Support on linux with samba package (on a server)

Compatible with Linux, MacOS and Windows

In addition to file-sharing, samba can provide print and login services
Needs a separate samba password
easy to access the same share on different systems


Samba SMB server configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
apt install samba
mkdir /srv/smbshare
touch /srv/smbshare/file{1..10}
set permissions appropriately for clients to access the shared space
vim /etc/samba/smb.conf
In this file, there are too many lines here which is almost distracting to a new user, but look for lines discussing [home] shares eg configuration.
[files]
comment = "Shared files for the team"
browseable = yes
path = /srv/smbshare

Run 'testparm' to check the smb conf file for syntax errors
sudo systemctl restart smbd

One more step to take before users can connect to the server. The samba server thinks of users differently than the rest of the system.
Need to create a password for each user that will connect to the server

smbpasswd -a username
-a to add a user
enter a password when prompted
This is independent of the linux account password


Client connection to samba server
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install the cifs-utils package
mkdir /mnt/sharedfiles
mount //ipaddress or hostname of server/name of the fileshare /mountpoint on local system -o username=sambausername
mount //10.0.2.10/files /mnt/sharedfiles -o username=scott
The // at the beginning is a samba-specific notation. Other protocols don't use them
If connecting to a windows SMB server, will need to specify a domain name -o domain
Can also use -o password (or else, enter the password when prompted)


The password thing is tricky a tricky situation to script the mount or use it in fstab to automount. This is one reason why the SMB password must be different than the login password
ls /mnt/sharedfiles
umount /mnt/sharedfiles

Automount
---------
/etc/fstab:

//10.0.2.10/files /mnt/sharedfiles cifs username=scott,password=pass,(,etc.) 0 0
cifs is the filesystem type
dump and pass parameters are 0 & 0
restart the system or run mount -a to automatically mount the share

Further settings in smb.conf
------------------------------
[global] applies to all shares
[homes] placeholder for user home shares
[printers]
Other parameters for a share
read only=yes
guest ok=yes  (guests do not need of username and password)
create mask=0770  for files. (0744) is the default. 0744 is for Full access to group members and no access to others
directory mask=0770
force user=username  (tell the server to treat all the users as a particular user. Same settings for groups)
hosts allow=10.0.2.0/255.255.255.0
Other options for LDAP or Kerberos

Further settings in client
------------------------------
-o to specify options that differ from the defaults
-o ro for read-only mounts
man mount.cifs
list clients with smbclient -L
