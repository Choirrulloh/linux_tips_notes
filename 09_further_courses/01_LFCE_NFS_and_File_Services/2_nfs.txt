NFS (files access over a network), developed at Sun Microsystems
shared folders and user-home folders in a multiuser network env
nfs shares are called exports
Access to nfs shares (exports) are granted to (hosts) computers, rather than users
Typically wired computers in a lab or organisational setting (like a hard drive or USB disk)
Prefers an ethernet cable (not a great idea over internet). Preferably only over a LAN

Permissions
-----------
Storage accessible at the host or system level
Security task is relegated to filesystem permissions
uses numeric ID of users accessing files on the export to determine access
if a user has ID 1005 in a machine, and a different user has ID 1005 on another machine, and they connect to a server, each user will have access to the other's files (since they have same numeric IDs)
Controlling UIDs is important, especially for user home folders
or we can configure nfs to simply ignore the UID completely
and specify a different one that all users would use instead if you want a big shared space where ownership does not matter


Server side
-----------
apt install nfs-kernel-server
mkdir /srv/shared
touch /srv/shared/file{1..10}
config file is /etc/exports
contains name of exports and the systems that are allowed to access them
eg config
use either ip address or fqdn or hostname (options within parenthesis, without leading parenthesis). One line per host. Blank parenthesis indicates read-only mounting
/srv/shared 10.0.2.0/24(rw)

Root squash
-----------
numeric uid is what is used to determine the share access
client UID = server UID  (eg. 1005 on client would have 1005 on server). Need co-ordinated creation of users on network or a centralised authentication scheme, we can sort this out.
But, if logged in as root on the workstation (uid=0) and then connect to server! They are root to the share on the server too!
root_squash directive indicates remap of uid 0 to 'nobody' user to limit access
all_squash will apply this behavior to all users
no_root_squash is the default (turns off this behavior)
/srv/shared 10.0.2.0/24(rw,root_squash)
Then run exportfs
systemctl status nfs-server
Then set individual folder/file permissions


Client setup
------------
apt install nfs-common
mkdir /mnt/sharedfiles
mount 10.0.2.10:/srv/shared /mnt/sharedfiles
can also mount the srv directory. Any other subfolders will also appear automatically
umount /mnt/shared

nfsstat -mounts

/etc/fstab
10.0.2.10:/srv/shared /mnt/sharedfiles nfs4 defaults 0 0
defaults - let the client and the server determine what settings to use
restart the system or mount -a

NFS config in details
--------------------
defaults should be fine for most people in most situations
sync option - write to disk asap (default)
async option - faster writes, possible data loss upon power failure
nobody user = anonymous
anonuid=uid/anongid=gid
man exports


On the client side, can set timeouts, size of requests to use when transferring data
