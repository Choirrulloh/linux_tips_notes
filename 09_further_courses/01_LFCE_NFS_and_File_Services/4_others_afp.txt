afp, linux package is netatalk (separate password like smb)
ftp = early days of the internet
credentials or anonymous (for software distributions)
iso files etc.

consider just using a web server if possible
cloud storage choices such as s3, dropbox, box etc. is better idea


sftp
local accounts on a server
filezilla, cyberdock
just ssh credentials
Access files within their own home folders on the server
not really helpful for shared access
