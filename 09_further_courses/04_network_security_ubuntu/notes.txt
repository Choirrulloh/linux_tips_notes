TLS configuration for web server is important
1. encrypt traffic
2. verify authenticity of server

let's encrypt is an awesome choice
self-signed certificates have no trust relationships

A certificate from a Certificate Authority allows the connection to be encrypted, and vouches for the authenticity of the server. .
Though they usually cost a little bit of money, a certificate from a CA is recommended for all public web servers.

openssl command creates a certificate and a key
mycert.key goes into /etc/ssl/private
cp mycert.pem into /etc/ssl/certs

edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf
change the SSLCertificateFile to /etc/ssl/certs/mycert.pem
change the SSLCertificateKeyFile to /etc/ssl/private/mycert.key

enable the site with a2ensite default-ssl.conf
a2enmod ssl
systemctl restart apache2

Apache has two logs (access log and error log) /var/log/apache2/access.log
error log /var/log/apache2/error.log (misconfigs, problems, warnings, php error log etc)
Where can you customize Apache's log file format and location?
/etc/apache2/apache2.conf and vhost .conf files.
Apache's flexible logging allows very granular access to customize logs.


If a browser requests a file that the web server can't find, there would be an entry in the /var/log/apache2/access.log file.

nc localhost 1214
ls -lh /proc/pid/fd
nmap -sT -sU localhost (show open tcp and udp ports on my system)
nmap -sT -sU -sV localhost (include a guess of service version numbers)

telnet localhost 22
