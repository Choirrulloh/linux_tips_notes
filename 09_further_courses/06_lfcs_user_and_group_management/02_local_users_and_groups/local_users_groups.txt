adding users

adduser, frontend for useradd
/etc/adduser.conf for defaults

create sub-folders for first letter of each username
LETTERHOMES=yes

sudo adduser myusername

To switch as this user, issue the command: su myusername

sudo adduser --system mysystemusername (for daemons and other processes)
id mysystemusername


passwd command (users can themselves change their passwords)

admin can also change it using sudo passwd username

chsh to change shell
chfn (Change info in the gecos field)

user's full name can be changed this way. But, user's login name has to be changed by usermod
sudo usermod -l <newusername> <oldusername>
sudo usermod -d </home/newusername> -m <newusername>
-d sets home folder for an account. -m moves the home folder for a user

deluser. can either backup user data or delete userdata


Groups
------

addgroup (can do either a regular group or system group)

sudo addgroup groupname
id command shows that a new user's primary group name will correspond to their own username

To add users to a group:
    sudo adduser username groupname
or  sudo usermod -a -G <groupname> <username>   !! ....note the change in the order!
-a (append rather than replace)
-G (list of groups to add to)

id taylor
id pat

some settings are in /etc/addusers.conf

groupmod command (change numeric groupid and the string-name of the group)
delgroup for deleting a group


Templated/Pre-configured environment for users/groups large-scale deployment
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
define a skeleton home folder (like /etc/skel)
Global environment settings (to provide a tool or library in the PATH)
/etc/adduser.conf  (DSHELL, which group new users are added to)
can put anything in /etc/skel
/etc/profile (global environment for all users)
and in the folder called /etc/profile.d/

Generally recommended to make a shell script inside the /etc/profile.d/ folder instead of directly editing /etc/profile script
