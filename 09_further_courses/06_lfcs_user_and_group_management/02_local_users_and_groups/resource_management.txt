/etc/security/limits.conf  is part of the PAM (can limit memory, open files, hard disk usage, max file size, processor time, process priority && others by user or by group)
look at the manpage for limits.conf

username/groupname/wildcard  soft/hard item_to_be_limiting  value_of_limiting

not more than 100MB file for pat (applied upon next login)
pat hard fsize 10000

Setting up quotas, using a package called quota (for limiting space on a per-user or per-group basis)
sudo apt install quota
filesystems must be remounted with support for user/group quotas
edit fstab to include that and restart 

example
fallocate -l 100MB /myfilesystem
mkfs.ext4 /myfilesystem
mkdir /mnt/myfs
mount -o usrquota /myfilesystem /mnt/myfs
quotacheck -c /mnt/myfs
edquota username/groupname (shall open up your editor)

Filesystem  blocks soft hard inodes soft hard
/dev/loop0  0      0    20M  0      0    0

chmod 777 /mnt/myfs
quotaon /mnt/myfs

while the user is logged in, they can use the 'quota' command to check what their limitations on each filesystems are

As an admin, can the repquota -a command to see a summary or a report on the quota status of my filesystems

shared folders
--------------
chgrp groupname </path/to/sharedfolder>
chmod g+rw </path/to/sharedfolder>
chmod g+s </path/to/sharedfolder>  (2775, 2 for octal permissons)


in /etc/sudoers file, the %sign at the beginning of an entry means that it is a group name
eg 
%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
