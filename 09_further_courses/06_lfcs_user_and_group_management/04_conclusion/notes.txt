who - currently logged in

last command shows a historical list of users logging into the system
lots of options (such as ranges to look between)
comes from /var/run/utemp and /var/log/wtmp files which are binary files, parsed by the last command


The lastlog command is very useful (on linux)
shows a listing of users known to the system and when they last logged in (if ever)
