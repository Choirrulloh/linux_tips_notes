Using a standard web host is a common scenario for using ftp
Defined in 1971
Many linux distro mirrors are ftp sites
Company ftp sites for software, downloads, drivers etc
ftp credentials are sent in plain text
therefore create specific account credentials for ftp access that is never used for any other account
alternatives are ftp-ssl and sftp
ftp://uname:passwd@example.com:21/file.zip
Originally designed for Active mode (server -> client when asked), but doesn't work anymore due to NATting
Now, commonly used in passive mode where client controls and sets up the connection
Default is port 22, but can open ports ad-hoc
