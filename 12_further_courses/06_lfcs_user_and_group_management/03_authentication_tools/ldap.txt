ldap-utils
slapd (actual ldap server)
can also manyally reconfigure using dpkg-reconfigure slapd
enter admin password for ldap

now, run dpkg-reconfigure slapd

choose no for 1st prompt
dns_domain: example.com (should be the fqdn)
organization name: example.com
type admin password again
database backend: MDB
remove database when slapd is purged: no
move old database: yes
allow ldap v2: no

Managing the server side is a little byond the scope (non-trivial)

easier admin tool is phd-ldap-admin (web based tool)
also, ldap-modify tool is a professional tool 

open a browser at localhost/phpldapadmin
login with admin password

Add a Group (OU)
example: people, which will contain the users

then start editing this new OU to add users in it (child entry)
note that the numeric userid  must not be the same as a local account
commit!

choose the user, and change the uid


client packages: nscd ldap-auth-client
enter the URI of the server eg. ldap://something_pointing_to_the_server
distinguished name of the search base
dc=example,dc=com  (for example.com)
dc is domain component


choose ldap version 3
make local root database admin: y/n? (enabled in the video)
does the ldap database require login?: n
ldap account for root: type the following:
cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
ldap root account password (for admin on the ldap server): enter it here

installation continues, and pam setup is done

can also dpkg-reconfigure ldap-auth-client

then edit /etc/nsswitch.conf file (name service switch) which contains information about where the system should look for password and group information

edit the passwd, group and shadow lines
compat: implies compatibility mode (directs nss to files on disk when looking for the user, /etc/passwd and such)
if ldap comes first, and ldap server is down, can cause the system to hang at boot
after compat , add the entry ldap 

grep ldap /etc/pam.d/*
these files are managed by the pam-auth-update tool

run pam-auth-update, and verify that ldap is indeed checked

can enable creation of home directory 
nano /etc/pam.d/common-session
find the line
session optional pam_mkhomedir.so skel=/etc/skel
sudo systemctl restart nscd

after logging in as an ldap user, the id command should show the ldap numeric id

manage carefully so that the local userid numbers and ldap userid numbers do not overlap/conflict
