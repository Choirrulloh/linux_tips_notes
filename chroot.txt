chroot
Isolates a process from rest of the filesystem
they can't access files outside their confined space
This can be useful for troubleshooting
For running a process in a space that is separated from the rest of the filesystem
Sets an effective root directory that the process can't see outside of
It can be used for some security purposes
Often used to provide a clean environment for building software
Not intended for complete security isolation
Using chroot, can specify the path to a directory that will act as the root directory for the process
Effective root of a new environment.
Also need to have the tools or programs required inside the new root path, or provide links to those places on the system

eg
mkdir ~/newroot
This will return an error: sudo chroot ~/newroot /bin/bash

Most software has dependencies (shared libraries etc)
Need to mount various parts of the filesystem such as /sys, /proc, or /bin inside the target root directory
or copy specific files to the new root
Very hard to get all dependencies right

ldd /bin/bash (shows the dependencies)
chroot is often used for rescue and installation

arch chroot (in its install media)
helpful for developers to set up a minimal environment
set up a script to take care of dependencies and mounting required filesystems
