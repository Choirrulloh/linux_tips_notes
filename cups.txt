sudo apt install cups
sudo systemctl enable cups
sudo systemctl start cups
management interface (service) runs on port 631
under the default configuration the service is only accessible from the localhost
So if you have to control remotely

sudo cupsctl --remote-admin
sudo ufw allow 631/tcp

Open up a browser, type the server's IP address:portno (631) eg
10.0.2.6:631

To add printers, users must be in the lpadmin group
sudo usermod -aG lpadmin scott

HP printers like to use their own drivers
sudo apt install hplip

sudo hp-setup -i
for interactive setup
Look for printers that have gutenprint or another cups support
